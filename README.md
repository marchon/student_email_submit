student_email_submit
====================

email_submit is an almost-stupidly simple system for managing submissions of student assignments (or whatever) via email. It takes care of extracting attachments from emails, naming them in a consistent way, and sending replies with comments attached.

(I don't use email_submit much myself any more, as I generally prefer to grade hard copies of student assignments. If I ever need it, I will probably merge email_submit's capabilities into schoolutils. But in the meantime, email_submit may be useful to anyone who grades electronically.)
